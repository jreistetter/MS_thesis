git repo to hold the code for Joe Reistetter MS thesis project.

Code is broken into three directories:
exprs - R scripts to obtain and discretize GEO accessions and format
		them for PMN software.
prot  - R and python scripts to obtain, filter, and format protein-protein
		and protein-DNA data for PMN software.
regulators - R and python scripts to create a pool of "regulators" and format
			for use in PMN software

Notes about the expression datasets:
GSE8786 - Raw data good, text format
GSE8839 - appears to be corrupted (some columns shifted in raw data)
            *Emailing GEO, ignore this dataset for now
GSE9331 - Raw data good, genepix file format (.gpr)
          It's 3 different platforms, and 4921 says channel 1 is cy5.
          Need to check this later to see if just entry error in GEO
          gpl4291 ch1 = cy5 = red
          gpl4293 ch1 = cy3 = green
          gpl5774 ch1 = cy3 = green
GSE10391 - Raw data good, text format
GSE16146 - get softfile via getGEO, raw data not available separately
