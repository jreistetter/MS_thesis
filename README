git repo to hold the code for Joe Reistetter MS thesis project.

Code is broken into three directories:
exprs - R scripts to obtain and discretize GEO accessions and format
		them for PMN software.
prot  - R and python scripts to obtain, filter, and format protein-protein
		and protein-DNA data for PMN software.
regulators - R and python scripts to create a pool of "regulators" and format
			for use in PMN software

Notes about the expression datasets:
GSE8786 (54) D	- Raw data good, text format
GSE8839 (131)	- appears to be corrupted (some columns shifted in raw data)
           		*Emailing GEO, ignore this dataset for now
GSE9331 (52) D	- Raw data good, genepix file format (.gpr)
	       			It's 3 different platforms, and 4921 says channel 1 is cy5.
          			Need to check this later to see if just entry error in GEO
          			gpl4291 ch1 = cy5 = red
			        gpl4293 ch1 = cy3 = green
         			gpl5774 ch1 = cy3 = green
GSE10391 (75) 	- Raw data doesn't include spot location info
				The column IDs also include the sample information,
				so read.maimages wont' work initially.
GSE16146 (80)	- get softfile via getGEO, raw data not available separately
